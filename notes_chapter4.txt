What I have done by the end of Chapter4:

1. Created a template
2. Created a new view within rango's views.py file
3. Served a static content: rango.jpg
4. Completed the exercises for this chapter:
	* Modified the about page using about.html
	* Served a media content: cat.jpg
	* Used render to generate the rendered response

I passed the tests for Chapter4;
What is more, as I have modified the about page, the previous tests for chapter3 fail this time.
